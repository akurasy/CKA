CSI

The CSI driver ensures that external volumes such as aws ebs can be attached to your Kubernetes pod. just as attaching a rexray volume to docker containers so it can be attached to an ebs volume. 


===============================

VOLUME

volume is used for data persistence.

apiVersion
kind
metadata
spec
  - containers
    -  image
       name
       volumeMount:
       - mountPath: /opt
         name: data-volume


    volume
    - name: data-volume
      hostpath:
      - path: /data
        type: directory



=======================================

PERSISTENCE VOLUME
This allows storage to be managed centrally. This is managed by an Admin


PERSISTENCE VOLUME CLAIM

This is created by the user to use the storage. This binds to a PV.
Once you create a PVC use it in a POD definition file by specifying the PVC Claim name under persistentVolumeClaim section in the volumes section like this:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim


The same is true for ReplicaSets or Deployments. Add this to the pod template section of a Deployment on ReplicaSet.

============================================

STORAGE CLASS

This is used in dynamic provisioning of volumes on google cloud


apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: google-storage
provisioner: Kubernetes.io/gce-pd
